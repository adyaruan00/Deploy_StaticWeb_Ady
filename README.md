# Deploy_StaticWeb_Ady

is a simple DevOps project using Vue.js project that automates the process of deploying static websites to GitHub Pages. I did this project aiming to learn how to integrate Github and Netlify. And also configuring Netlify and Github to be able to do Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment using Webhooks so that when updating the code it will automatically build directly on Netlify without having to build manually.

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the Deploy_StaticWeb_Ady project, you'll need to have Node.js and Git installed on your system. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can follow these steps to deploy your website:

Clone this repo on you local system and try to change the code and push it to the repository back again.

Replace the sample static website files in the public directory with your own website files.

Wait for the deployment to finish.
That's it! Your website should now be deployed to GitHub Pages and accessible at https://<username>.github.io/<repository>.](https://6418199b1967a30008dbd322--deploy-test-ady.netlify.app/
